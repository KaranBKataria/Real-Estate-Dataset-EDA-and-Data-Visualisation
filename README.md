# Real-Estate-Dataset-EDA-and-Data-Visualisation

The purpose of this repo is to move onto EDA and Data Visualisation now that the Tennessee Real Estate dataframe has been cleaned. You can find the cleaning process on the repo titled: 'Housing-Dataset-Data-Cleaning'.

After producing visualisations/graphs and conducting EDA, here are the following insights I have gained about the dataset:

1) 73.9% of all properties were sold for MORE than the total value of the property and 88.0% were sold for MORE than the total building value

2) Only 26.1% of all properties were sold BELOW their total value

3) Total property value is highly (linearly) postively correlated to the Sale Price (which is to be expected)

4) Acreage is surprisingly NOT correlated to the sale price - a possible explanation for this is that 'Industrial' property type had the largest average acreage of 8.3 (which was 4.4x the average acreage of the sum of all the other property types) whilst making up 0.03% of the total Tennessee real estate market

5) Despite making up 0.03% of the market, the 'Industrial' property type had the 2nd highest average sale price and total value

6) Whilst making up 98.9% of the market, the 'Residential' property type had the 3rd highest average total value and sale price

7) Despite Nashville having the 2nd highest average sale price and total value (cost), it made up 78.8% of the Tennessee real estate market
